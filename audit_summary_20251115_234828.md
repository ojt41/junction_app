## Status Breakdown

### ❌ Non-Compliant (4)

#### moe_guide_0003

**Confidence:** 0.80

**Analysis:** The MOE manual does not adequately address the MOE Guide requirement for the statement by the Accountable Manager. The date on the MOE implementation is 05 Oct 17, which is prior to the regulatory context's requirement for the statement dated 02 Jan 2020. The regulatory context requires that the statement must be current and reflect the organization's commitment to compliance with EASA regulations as outlined in Part 145.A.30 and AMC 145.A.30. The absence of a current signature and date indicates a lack of compliance with the requirement for a corporate commitment by the Accountable Manager.

**Gaps:**
- The statement by the Accountable Manager is outdated and does not reflect current compliance.
- Lack of signatures and dates that align with the regulatory requirements.

**Recommendation:** Update the MOE manual to include a current statement by the Accountable Manager, signed and dated to reflect compliance with EASA regulations.

#### moe_guide_0096

**Confidence:** 0.70

**Analysis:** The MOE manual does not adequately address the MOE Guide requirement 3.11 regarding qualification procedures for specialised activities such as NDT and welding. While it references Part 145.A.30 (f) and EN 4179, it states that the organization does not hold any specialised approvals under Part 145, which indicates a lack of internal capability to perform these tasks. Furthermore, the sourcing of an appropriately approved supplier is mentioned, but there is no detailed procedure outlined for how this will be managed or documented, which is necessary for compliance with AMC/GM guidance.

**Gaps:**
- Lack of detailed procedures for sourcing and managing specialised services.
- No internal capability for specialised tasks as per regulatory requirements.
- Insufficient documentation on how approved suppliers are evaluated and selected.

**Recommendation:** Develop and document a comprehensive procedure for sourcing and managing specialised services, including evaluation criteria for suppliers and monitoring processes.

#### moe_guide_0116

**Confidence:** 0.70

**Analysis:** The MOE manual does not adequately address the MOE Guide requirement for a List of Effective Pages. Specifically, the MOE implementation lacks the necessary details such as the name of the organization, the date of review, approval, and the name of the person who has reviewed and approved the MOE, as required by [REG-2]. The provided List of Issues/Amendments does not include these critical elements, which are essential for traceability and compliance monitoring. Additionally, the revision history does not clearly indicate the approval status as required by [REG-1].

**Gaps:**
- Missing organization name in the List of Effective Pages.
- Lack of review and approval details in the MOE implementation.
- Revision history does not indicate approval status.

**Recommendation:** Update the MOE manual to include the organization name, review and approval details, and ensure the revision history reflects the approval status as per EASA requirements.

---

#### moe_guide_0134

**Confidence:** 0.80

**Analysis:** The MOE manual does not adequately address the requirement for maintaining a list of temporary line maintenance locations as specified in the MOE Guide requirement 1.8.3. While the implementation sections 1.8.4 and 5.3 are present, section 5.3 states 'There are no line maintenance locations at present,' which does not fulfill the requirement to maintain a list of temporary line maintenance locations. This is a direct contradiction to the requirement that such a list should be maintained. Additionally, the MOE manual does not specify how temporary line maintenance locations will be approved as per 1.8.4, which is necessary for compliance.

**Gaps:**
- No list of temporary line maintenance locations is maintained as required.
- Lack of procedures for the approval of temporary line maintenance locations.

**Recommendation:** Revise the MOE manual to include a maintained list of temporary line maintenance locations and establish procedures for their approval.
